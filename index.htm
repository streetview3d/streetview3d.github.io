<h1>Street View 3D</h1>

<p><i>Navigate smoothly through Google Street View in a reconstructed 3D scene.</i></p>

<p>While traditional Street View offers a single-perspective panorama with controls for switching to adjacent panoramas, Street View 3D utilizes depth information to show the scene from different perspectives, which works with plain HTML5. There are 3D buildings in Google Earth, but this is not available for all places nor does it run in the browser.</p>

<p>The location can be specified in the browser's address bar by typing in the address of the desired location or its geographical coordinates, as they are found on Google Maps.</p>
