<h1>Street View 3D</h1>
<p><i>Navigate smoothly through Google Street View in a reconstructed 3D scene.</i></p>
<p>While traditional Street View offers a single-perspective panorama with controls for switching to adjacent panoramas, Street View 3D utilizes depth information to show the scene from different perspectives, which works with plain HTML5. There are 3D buildings in Google Earth, but this does not work for all places nor in the browser.</p>
<p>The location can be specified in the browser's address bar by typing in the address of the desired location or its geographical coordinates, as they are found on Google Maps.</p>
<h3>Control Keys</h3>
<p>Use the cursor keys (arrow keys) on the right side of your keyboard to look around. Use the keys with the letters W, A, S and D to move. Press W or S to move forwards or backwards and A or D to move sideways. The next panorama will be loaded automatically while you are moving along the street.</p>
<h3>Mobile Buttons</h3>
Mobile devices often have no keyboards. Press "Show buttons" to steer on a touch screen.
<h3>Performance Modes</h3>
The quality of the composed image is a tradeoff between rendering correctness and performance. If the performance is not satisfying in your case, switch "Quality mode on" to "Performance mode on" by clicking on it.
<h3>Tested Browser compatibility</h3>
